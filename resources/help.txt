SYNOPSIS

    rolling-update [global-options] [TARGET...]

DESCRIPTION

    rolling-update is a tool which allows you to automate rolling
    restart of cloud entities such as auto-scaling groups on AWS.

GLOBAL-OPTIONS

    -h, --help
        It displays this page.


    -v, --version
        It shows the tool's version.


    --dryrun, --dry-run, --show-plan
        Just print the plan without performing any step.


    --grace-period <time-in-seconds>  (default: 60s)
        The time to wait after the new the new instance comes to live
        before starting terminating the next one.
        This time is useful for stateful services such as databases
        to allow the new joined instance to synch up with the rest
        of the cluster. The amount of time required depends on the
        specific of the application and the amount of data to transfer.
        Values are in seconds, a suffix can be added to specify the
        time unit such as: `s` for seconds, `m` minutes, `h` hours.

TARGET

    The auto-scaling group (or groups) which need to be restarted.

    By name: web-app* or booking-asg
        It supports glob matching (? for any singe char, * for any
        number of any char). If provided it will be matched against
        the auto-scaling group names.

    By tag:  tag:<tag-name>=<tag-value>
        It matches the auto-scaling groups with have a tag which
        matches the given tag-name and tag-value pair.
        Examples:
           tag:Foo=bar
           tag:service=booking-service
           tag:GroupName='Any group value'

STRATEGIES

    Currently, the only supported strategy is `terminate-and-wait`.
    It terminates one instance from the selected auto-scaling group
    and it waits until the auto-scaling group stabilizes back with
    a new instance coming into service. After that there is a waiting
    grace period to allow the new instance to join the cluster and
    synchronize with the rest of the group (if necessary).
